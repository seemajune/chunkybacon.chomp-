I spoke to several interesting people, and many of these conversations were inspiring and insightful. One guy in particular, who is an avid JS fan, and graduate of Flatiron's Ruby 004 class, explained to me how awesome the language is because you can use it for both front and back end. I never thought about it this way, I hear about and am interested in learning Node (over the holidays is my goal). I'm a highly visual learner, and I like seeing the outcome of my work on the browser in an aesthetically pleasing way. There are ways you can do this with Ruby. For example, in one project I implemented the Charkick.js gem, that allowed me to take data values in Ruby format and display them in a visually stunning manner, directly from an html.erb file. </h4>
        <h4>About a month ago we took a week to cover JavaScript. When learning a new programming language, having previously been exposed to only one, certain conventions may cause confusion. In order to strengthen my JS skills, && explore the similarities and differences between Ruby <> JS, I thought a good first step would be to revisit a simple program from one of our labs, and translate it from Ruby to JavaScript.</h4>
        <h4> I have a lot of fun learning.</h4>
